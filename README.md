# Parkinsons-Disease-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning
Parkinsonâ€™s disease is a progressive disorder of the central nervous system affecting movement and inducing tremors and stiffness. It has 5 stages to it and affects more than 1 million individuals every year in India. This is chronic and has no cure yet. It is a neurodegenerative disorder affecting dopamine-producing neurons in the brain.
The dataset has 24 columns and 195 records and is only 39.7 KB, we can get the dataset through kaggle.

Steps to implement in the project are :- 
1. we need to import te dependencies  
2.Data Collection and Analysis
3.We need to label the data 
4. Data Pre-Processing
***Separating the features and target 
***Splitting the data to training data & Test data
5.Model Training
**We used SVM and we evaluted this model and we got an accuracy of 87%

From, this we constructed a Predictive system with this model.
